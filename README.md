# Media Whisperer

The goal of this project is to automatically download a feed to consume the latest information and compile it into a digestable format either as a quick notes page or as a easy to listen to podcast.

## Use Case

I'm a huge Disney fan that listen to every Podcast under the sun regarding the parks, Star Wars and Marvel.  I also watch a lot of YouTube videos, read blogs, follow creators, and so on.  

Rather than consuming it all individually, I plan to scoop up the content once a day or week.  Then I can compile a list of interesting news, stories and facts.

## The Plan

### Extract

- [ ] Download Podcast Script
- [ ] Download YouTube Videos Script

### Transform

- [ ] Convert Audio/Video into Text
- [ ] Compile Transformed Text into Notes

### Load
